INTRODUCTION

The E-Ration project is a digital initiative designed to modernize and streamline the management of ration shops, making the process more efficient and transparent. Traditionally, ration distribution involves various manual tasks, such as managing product inventories, processing user requests, and handling billing. This project aims to replace these manual processes with a user-friendly digital system.

The system is structured around three primary roles: Admin, Ration Shopkeepers, and Users. The Admin oversees the entire platform, managing and updating product details for different types of ration cards and maintaining user information. The Admin also handles the approval of ration shop registrations, ensuring that only verified shops are included in the system.

Ration Shopkeepers play a crucial role in the system. After registering their shop and receiving approval from the Admin, they can access the system using a unique ration shop ID and password. They can then add products from supplyco and other ration items, view product details and user information provided by the Admin, manage billing processes, and oversee the shopping cart for their customers.

Users interact with the system to manage their ration-related needs. They can search for and view ration shops within their municipality, explore available supplyco and ration products, add items to their cart, and view their bills.

The E-Ration project aims to improve the overall efficiency of ration distribution, ensuring accurate management and transparency for both shopkeepers and users.
